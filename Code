// Programming Assignment- Guessing Game-
// 
// This program asks the user to guess a number between 1 and a constant MAX. The program 
// gives hints to whether the random number generated is higher or lower than the user's 
// guess. Scanner is used to read input and Random is used to generate a random number. When 
// the game(s) is over the results are reported.
